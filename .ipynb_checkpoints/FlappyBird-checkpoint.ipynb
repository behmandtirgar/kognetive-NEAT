Faby briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Faby falls because of gravity; each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game. \"  [![Img AltText](src/logo_link.jpg)](https://github.com/GuidebeeGameEngine/FlappyBird \"Source\")\n",
